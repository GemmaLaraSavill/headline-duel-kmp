    <string name="information_body">This app is powered by a fine-tuned DistilBERT model for news classification.\n\nThe model was originally trained as part of my Udacity Nanodegree project, using the AG News dataset, and then fine-tuned with LoRA adapters for efficiency.\n\nTo bring the project into the “real world,” I uploaded the model to Hugging Face and exposed it via an API. Headline Duel is the next step: a KMP app where humans can classify news headlines and compare their answers against the model’s predictions.\n\nThis closes the loop between my work in machine learning and my core experience in mobile development — showing how AI can be tested, validated, and integrated into practical mobile experiences.</string>
